Vue JS 
1. Text interpolation binding
2. Two way data binding
3. So far looks like a mix of angular and react


### Questions so far
1. the mapState, mapGetters, mapMutations all take strings instead of function names like in mapDispatchToProps, mapStateToProps in react makes it easier to do typo and mistakes
2. so far haven't seen a way for functional/presentational components, every component has to implement mapState, mapGetters andm mapMutations
