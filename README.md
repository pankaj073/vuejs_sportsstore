Vue JS 
1. Text interpolation binding
2. Two way data binding
3. So far looks like a mix of angular and react


### Questions so far
1. the mapState, mapGetters, mapMutations all take strings instead of function names like in mapDispatchToProps, mapStateToProps in react makes it easier to do typo and mistakes
2. So it has functional or presentation components you can pass props to, but yet to see if they are as efficient as presentational components, like they can't have their own state.
3. Need to find out what is this $ character used everywhere $watch, $dirty, $emit, $invalid
